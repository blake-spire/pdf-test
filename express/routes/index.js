potential for, pollutants leaving the construction site boundaries, entering the stormwater drainage system, or discharging to state waters: construction site perimeter, all disturbed areas, designated haul routes, material and waste storage areas exposed to precipitation, locations where stormwater has the potential to discharge offsite, and locations where vehicles exit the site.\n\nThe permittee must ensure all control measures remain in effective operating condition and are working as designed in their specifications to minimize pollutant discharges.  Determine if there are new potiential sources of pollutants. Assess the adequacy of control measures at the site to identify areas requiring new or modified control measures to minimize pollutant discharges.  Identify all areas of non-compliance with the permit requirements and, if necessary, implement corrective actions.  \n\nControl Measures must be maintained in accordance with good engineering, hydrologic and pollution control practices. Control Measure Requiring Routine Maintenance is defined as any control measure that is still operating in accordance with its design and the requirements of this permit, but requires maintenance to prevent a breach of the control measure. See also inadequate control measure. \n\nThe permittee must assess the adequacy of control measures at the site, and the need for changes to those control measures to ensure continued effective performance. When an inadequate control measure is identified (e.g.,, new or replacement control measures become necessary), the following corrective action requirements apply. The permittee is in noncompliance with the permit until the inadequate control measure is replaced or corrected and returned to effective operating condition in compliance. If the inadequate control measure results in noncompliance that meets the conditions of Part II.L., the permittee must also meet the requirements of that section. Inadequate Control Measure is defined as any control measure that is not designed or implemented in accordance with the requirements of the permit and/or any control measure that is not implemented to operate in accordance with its design. \n\nIf a new control measures is needed the inspector must determine if that new control measure is categorized as “inadequate or maintenance” based on the definitions above. \n\nAll control measures identified in the SWMP shall be evaluated to ensure that they are maintained and operating correctly. Identify the condition of the control measure as either inadequate or in need of maintenance as defined above.  Continuous and proactive maintenance is required on all Control Measures. Control Measures that are not operating effectively, have proven to be inadequate, or failed must be addressed as soon as possible, immediate in most cases.","input_attributes":{},"input_validation_rules":null,"parent_question_id":null,"parent_option_id":null,"can_comment":null,"question_type_id":16,"sort_order":1,"description":null,"answer":"","comment":"","options":[{"id":30,"name":"In SWMP Design","description":"","child_questions":[]},{"id":31,"name":"In Use","description":"","child_questions":[]},{"id":32,"name":"Not Needed","description":"","child_questions":[]}]},"64":{"id":150,"input_label":"","input_attributes":{},"input_validation_rules":null,"parent_question_id":null,"parent_option_id":null,"can_comment":true,"question_type_id":18,"sort_order":1,"description":null,"answer":"[\"\",\"Eu nihil fuga Quide\",\"Quia et dolor tempor\",\"Dolore eum a unde of\"]","comment":"","options":[]},"65":{"id":151,"input_label":"","input_attributes":{},"input_validation_rules":null,"parent_question_id":null,"parent_option_id":null,"can_comment":true,"question_type_id":18,"sort_order":2,"description":null,"answer":"[\"\",\"Non sunt neque deser\",\"Pariatur Ex reprehe\",\"Quia asperiores veni\"]","comment":"","options":[]},"66":{"id":152,"input_label":"","input_attributes":{},"input_validation_rules":null,"parent_question_id":null,"parent_option_id":null,"can_comment":true,"question_type_id":18,"sort_order":3,"description":null,"answer":"[\"\",\"Porro non sed dolor \",\"Rerum reprehenderit \",\"Nostrum irure ipsam \"]","comment":"","options":[]},"67":{"id":153,"input_label":"","input_attributes":{},"input_validation_rules":null,"parent_question_id":null,"parent_option_id":null,"can_comment":true,"question_type_id":18,"sort_order":4,"description":null,"answer":"[\"\",\"Atque voluptatem eli\",\"Consequatur tempore\",\"Non maxime ea sequi \"]","comment":"","options":[]},"68":{"id":154,"input_label":"","input_attributes":{},"input_validation_rules":null,"parent_question_id":null,"parent_option_id":null,"can_comment":true,"question_type_id":18,"sort_order":5,"description":null,"answer":"[\"\",\"Veritatis culpa cum \",\"Ut beatae veniam an\",\"Anim rerum nobis qua\"]","comment":"","options":[]},"69":{"id":155,"input_label":"","input_attributes":{},"input_validation_rules":null,"parent_question_id":null,"parent_option_id":null,"can_comment":true,"question_type_id":18,"sort_order":6,"description":null,"answer":"[\"\",\"Cumque voluptate exp\",\"Id vel repellendus\",\"Culpa sint ipsa id \"]","comment":"","options":[]},"70":{"id":156,"input_label":"","input_attributes":{},"input_validation_rules":null,"parent_question_id":null,"parent_option_id":null,"can_comment":true,"question_type_id":18,"sort_order":7,"description":null,"answer":"[\"\",\"Totam nobis voluptat\",\"Ullam esse quidem es\",\"Maxime irure nihil s\"]","comment":"","options":[]},"71":{"id":157,"input_label":"","input_attributes":{},"input_validation_rules":null,"parent_question_id":null,"parent_option_id":null,"can_comment":true,"question_type_id":18,"sort_order":8,"description":null,"answer":"[\"\",\"Minima cumque veniam\",\"In placeat optio c\",\"Exercitationem et al\"]","comment":"","options":[]},"72":{"id":158,"input_label":"","input_attributes":{},"input_validation_rules":null,"parent_question_id":null,"parent_option_id":null,"can_comment":true,"question_type_id":18,"sort_order":9,"description":null,"answer":"[\"\",\"Aut qui quam est ani\",\"Dolore exercitation \",\"Optio non aut offic\"]","comment":"","options":[]},"73":{"id":148,"input_label":"Is there evidence of discharge of sediment or other pollutants from the site?","input_attributes":{},"input_validation_rules":null,"parent_question_id":null,"parent_option_id":null,"can_comment":null,"question_type_id":4,"sort_order":1,"description":"*If yes, explain the location of discharge and the corrective actions in the Construction Site Assessment section or General Notes","answer":"2","comment":"","options":[]},"74":{"id":149,"input_label":"Has sediment or other pollutants discharging from the site reached state waters or municipal separate storm sewer system?","input_attributes":{},"input_validation_rules":null,"parent_question_id":null,"parent_option_id":null,"can_comment":null,"question_type_id":4,"sort_order":1,"description":"If yes, contact Xcel Energy’s Environmental Services (303)294-2189.
